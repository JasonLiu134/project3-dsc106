    <h2>Write-Up</h2>
    <p>
        Even being the studious students that we are, midterms and finals never seem to get easy, and no amount of preparation can reduce the amount of stress we feel leading up to, and during the exam. The stress that we feel often makes us both restless and exhausted, and it’s possible that our performance on the tests themselves can be affected. Our project aims to analyze how the heart rates of 10 different students fluctuate while taking midterms and finals in order to see if stress influences students during exams. 
	<br><br>
Working with a messy dataset, we had to preprocess the data by filtering out null or zero values so that only valid BPM readings are plotted and used in the aggregation for each of the student line plots and also the average BPM line plots. We also had to make sure our x-axis included time in minutes, since the index provided by the dataset was not in any kind of time scale; we used the information about the length of the exams (roughly 3 hours for finals and 90 minutes for midterms) to scale the index accordingly to match with the time that we wanted. Furthermore, we decided to utilize line plots because we wanted to measure the heart rate over the course of time (in this instance, it was the various times during testing sessions between three different exams). We considered other possibilities such as comparing exam scores and average heart rate as a scatterplot, but we believe that the line plot we chose represents the data the best since line plots are good at capturing time-series data. This allows us to highlight the various trends and fluctuations for each student and the averages over time. Lastly, our y-axis was set at 0-200 since 200 BPM is around the maximum value present in our data, and this allows us to accurately depict BPM in our visualization without making the scale too large or small. 
<br><br>
After we decided on using a line plot, we initially plotted all 10 students and 3 exams at the same time - this resulted in extreme visual clutter that made it impossible to understand anything that was happening. To help clearly differentiate between multiple students, two different design choices were made. First, we used D3's color scheme as a guideline to style each students’ line plot as a different color, helping readers easily understand which line belonged to which student. We also decided to add a filter feature, allowing users to select which students they wanted to see plotted in order to help filter out unnecessary student data if needed, which helps reduce the amount of visual clutter. Users can easily click on the buttons under the plot to filter the plot by both student and exam. Our visualization also provides a legend above the plot that allows for an easier viewing experience, as it showcases the current exam selected and the students with their respective assigned colors alongside the grade they received on the current exam. Initially, we wanted the legend to be the interactive part of our visualization that we could click on, but we ran into some challenges - particularly, the size of the legend was a little hard to manage, which made the user have to scroll around in order to access the visualization and its features. We created buttons instead to help make things more organized, and it ended up looking quite clean!
<br><br>
After we had these issues solved, we wanted to be able to display some aggregate statistics as well as allow readers to look at data through filtering. In order to allow users to be able to obtain more information from our plot, we decided to include brushing tools in our visualization which can highlight specific portions of the plot to look at important aggregate statistics within that range. Furthermore, a tooltip is also shown when hovering over the main selected line plot to clearly see the student's heart rate at that time. This is done to allow users to be able to see small details, such as exact values where the data spikes or dips sharply. Furthermore, two buttons on the top right allow the user to view the current average data, and overall average data for the exam. To elaborate, the overall average plot is a line that depicts the average of all the students across the exam time. To allow students to see more aggregate information, they can also view the current average data, which shows a plot for the average BPM of only the students selected. This allows users to compare the mean data overlaid on top of the raw data, allowing for comparisons to be drawn between the students’ heart rates, the grades they received, and how that might compare to the mean. Small details like styling often got overlooked but we made sure to make the website's interactive elements look as good as they do with the color-coding and consistent formatting! 
<br><br>
In terms of approaching our research question, we wanted to present a visualization that could be capable of answering more specific questions derived from our overall question, “How does stress influence students during exams?”. For example, this question can be answered through various approaches, such as looking at the grade received for multiple students, as well as the average heart rate, and draw conclusions based on the data. If several students are plotted, with students having higher grades having heart rates that are generally higher than students with lower grades, then a potential answer that could be worth looking into is that students who receive good grades generally feel more stress during exams. Another example of how this visualization can be used is to look into questions such as “when do students feel the most stress during exams?”, which can be easily answered using the mean data feature and the brushing. By brushing and filtering the student data near the end of the exam and the beginning, it can be easy to compare when students have higher heart rates on average. Users can also look at the average BPM plots to observe the overall average trend for heart rate across each exam, and try and see if there is a general increase in heart rate as the exam goes on.

In terms of the team development process and the work that was split among the members of Visualizing Crashouts, we did it through Github Projects where we created multiple issues and assigned tasks to everybody, and we worked individually for some time and checked in every day. Jason handled most of the line plot generation where he made the line plots for the students’ corresponding to the selected exam, created the highlight feature of the graph, as well as the tooltips that appear when highlighting. He was responsible for providing the skeletal structure of the line plot, which helped speed up the development process for the rest of the team, and also creating the filtering features present in the plot with help from Ishaan and Hansel. Jason also made and color-coded buttons of the three different exams and the students, which Hansel styled and made it look much more professional. Hansel was in charge of creating and formatting the brush selection feature, which was challenging to create on top of the other interactive features, but he persevered and got it done in a timely manner. His brush selection allowed for more in depth analysis and comparisons for subregions of the line plots that were generated. He also handled most of the overall styling and general formatting of the html itself, helping to bring out the visualization to its full potential, as he made sure elements were not overlapping and stayed consistent all throughout the page. Ishaan was responsible for fine tuning the axes of the graph as he created the labelings and reindexed the x-axis from number of rows to minutes passed for the scope of this research question. He also introduced the idea of toggleable buttons through the legend as it was later refigured towards buttons under the graph itself. Last but not least, he contributed significantly to the writeup, with some minor touch ups from the others.
<br><br>
	The overall project took about 4-5 days to complete with 2 days spent sifting through the data and going through visualizations for the checkpoint, and 3 days spent on working on the website and interactive visualization. Most time was spent upgrading the line graph, as we continuously added upon new ideas into it, however the initial set up of the line plot was the primary time issue. As it was the core of the website, it was difficult to set it up from scratch while making it applicable to other features that may be included in the future. The lab was a helpful resource as a source of inspiration, as it had its own template for a scatter plot. Setting up d3 brushX was another issue we encountered as the brush function was not showing up on the graph forcing a lot of debugging to figure out the core issue. Several tutorials were helpful insights on how to set up the functions for brush commands and eventually one tutorial came through with a solution to fix the issue. Finally, the legend was a confusing issue as the idea of what the legend should look like was unclear but with the help of some TAs in office hours, they helped us in delivering the final product that is now a dynamic updating legend.For future team collaborations, we should definitely start a little bit earlier as the project was a rather short time window one with strict guidelines to meet. Not only that, we also should prioritize the more important parts of the project first rather than simple and easy objectives so that we could meet the deadlines sooner than later.
